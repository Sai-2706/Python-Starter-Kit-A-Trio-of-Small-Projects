 PDF to Text Converter project in terminal:

1. Set up the environment
Step 1: Open your terminal
You can use the terminal in VS Code, Command Prompt, or your system's terminal.

Step 2: Create a new project folder
Run the following commands:

bash
Copy code
mkdir pdf_to_text_project
cd pdf_to_text_project
2. Set up a virtual environment
A virtual environment ensures project dependencies are isolated.

Step 1: Create a virtual environment
Run:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Step 2: Activate the virtual environment
For Windows:
bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
For Linux/Mac:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
You should see (venv) appear at the beginning of the terminal, meaning the virtual environment is active.

3. Install the required library
Run the following to install PyPDF2:

bash
Copy code
pip install PyPDF2
4. Create the Python script
Create a new Python file called pdf_to_text.py:

touch pdf_to_text.py
Open the file using your editor:
bash
Copy code
code pdf_to_text.py
Or open it with Notepad or any editor you prefer.
5. Add the code
Paste the following code into pdf_to_text.py:

python
Copy code
import PyPDF2

# Input and output file paths
input_pdf = "sample.pdf"  # Replace with your PDF file name
output_txt = "output_text.txt"

# Open the PDF file
with open(input_pdf, "rb") as file:
    reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)
    text = ""
    for page in reader.pages:
        text += page.extract_text()

# Write the extracted text to a file
with open(output_txt, "w", encoding="utf-8") as output_file:
    output_file.write(text)

print(f"Text extracted and saved to {output_txt}")
6. Add a PDF file
Place your PDF file (e.g., sample.pdf) inside the project folder.

7. Run the script
Run the Python script in the terminal:

bash
Copy code
python pdf_to_text.py
If the script runs successfully:

The extracted text will be saved in a file called output_text.txt in your project folder.
Youâ€™ll see a confirmation message in the terminal.
